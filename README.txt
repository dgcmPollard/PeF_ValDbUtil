# README for PeF_ValDbUtil git project repository
# Author: David Pollard (david@pollardsetfilles.com)

This Python project belongs to Pollards Et Filles Ltd. (PeF)
It uses GitHub as its remote repository for source code

PeF_ValDbUtil contains modules and executable scripts that
interact with PeFValDb the financial asset value time-series 
MySQL database used by Pollards Et Filles.
The repository will be written in Python as much as possible

Aug 2012:  Current functionality is mostly for bulk data insertions into PeFValDb.  
These were used to back populate PeFValDb with prices since 
2003 for GASCI equities and 2006 for TTSE equities.
Functionality will be added for web ripping of price data from
the GASCI, TTSE and other web-sites for incremental addition to PeFValDb.
